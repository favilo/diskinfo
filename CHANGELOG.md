  `Disk.get_smart_data()` methods
- New attributed added for `NvmeAttributes()` class
- New attributed added for `DiskSmartData()` class

### Changed
- support of Python 3.7 removed

### Fixed
- LOOP disks handled without problems
- `Disk.get_smart_data()` can be executed on a wider range of hard disks and SSDs without problems


## [2.1.2] - 2024-01-02

### Added
- New chapter for explaining the use of `create_python_env.sh`

### Fixed

- Unit tests has been extended to cover the new functionality

### Changed
- Demo cannot be executed without [`rich`](https://pypi.org/project/rich/) Python library


## [1.3.1] - 2022-10-06

### Fixed
